### Project: Defeat the Evil Wizard ###

Overview:

In this mini-project, I created hero characters to battle the powerful Evil Wizard. 
You'll see Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, new character's, special abilities, and more! 
Through this simple menu system, you'll control your character by choosing actions like attacking, using special abilities, healing, and viewing stats.

Your Journey Awaits!
