# Project: Defeat the Evil Wizard 

## Overview:

- In this mini-project, I created hero characters to battle the powerful Evil Wizard.

- Through a simple menu system, you'll control your character by choosing actions like attacking, using special abilities, healing, and viewing stats. Your task is to defeat the Evil Wizard!
